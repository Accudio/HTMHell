## Issues and how to fix them

1. You don‚Äôt need the `tabindex` attribute if you use an `a` tag. HTML hyperlinks are focusable by default.
2. The `type` attribute on `a` tag is used to hint at the linked URL‚Äôs format with a MIME type, eg: `type="image/svg+xml"`
3. Using `role=link` on an `a` tag is not needed since you already get that behaviour for free by using a standard hyperlink (`<a href="">`).
4. {{ snippets.negative_tabindex }}
1. An additional `span` to handle focus isn‚Äôt necessary, `a` can do that by itself. üí™üèª
5. {{ snippets.i_elem }}
1. If you‚Äôre using `aria-hidden` on an element, you don‚Äôt need to declare a `role`, because the element is inaccessible to screen reader users, anyway.
1. {{ snippets.dom_size}} {{ snippets.dom_tree }} {{ snippets.divspanusage }}
6. Icon option 1: While `aria-hidden` can be useful to hide content that is not needed for screen readers (in this case an icon image), it's useful to add an `aria-label` when that content is meaningul for everyone, like declaring that an hyperlink will open in an external tab.
1. Icon option 2: The icon can be removed, because in the original snippet the link points to a page on the same site that opens in the same tab. The external link icon is intended to inform users that by clicking the link they‚Äôre leaving the site.
