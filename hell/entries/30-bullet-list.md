## Issues and how to fix them

1. Use `<p>` for paragraphs, not lists. The standard way for creating basic lists is `<ul>` (when the order doesn't matter) or `<ol>` (when the order matters), and `<li>` for each item.
1. The “list” won't be announced as a list when using a screen reader.
1. `<ul>` and `<ol>` provide [useful semantic information](/tips/ol-vs-ul-vs-div/). What and how assistive technology announces information differs, but:
    1. screen readers might announce it as a “list with items”
    1. screen readers might announce the number of items in the list, e.g. “list with 3 items”
    1. screen readers might announce the bullet or number of each item
    1. screen readers might announce when you enter or leave a list
1. Screen reader users may use shortcuts to jump from list to list on a page
1. `<ul>` and `<ol>` provide a selector for styling in CSS
1. When copying the fake list, all the bullets will go along with it
1. You can turn the bullet into a fire emoji using `::marker` 🔥
