  <code>avif</code> is a fairly new image format and for me it's one of the most exciting recent additions to web development. Why? On a website I recently built, I could reduce the total image size from 1.72MB to 172KB just by converting images to <code>avif</code>.
</p>

<!-- teaser -->

<p>
  That sounds too good to be true, so let me start with the bad news: Chrome, Chrome for Android, Opera, Opera Mobile and Samsung Internet are the only browsers to support <code>avif</code> at the moment. Firefox supports it behind a flag.
</p>

<h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>

<p>
  That’s not terrible, but it isn’t good either. The good news is that we can leverage the built-in progressive enhancement mechanisms of HTML to provide users with fallback image formats in case they’re using a browser that doesn’t suppor <code>avif</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The markup for the screenshot above looks like this:
</p>

{% highlight "html" %}
<picture>
  <source srcset="/images/7_avif-support.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="/images/7_avif-support.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="/images/7_avif-support.jpg" width="740" height="251" alt="caniuse.com browser support chart for the avif image format" loading="lazy">
</picture>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  We provide browsers with a set of images. The browser goes through this set and stops at the first format it can interpret. Chrome stops at the first <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element because it supports the <code>avif</code> format, Edge skips the first line and uses the <code>webp</code> image in the second line and IE skips both lines and uses the <code>jpg</code> referenced in the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.
</p>

<h2>webp Browser Support</h2>

<p>
  You might even stop using <code>jpg</code> altogether because support for the <code>webp</code> image format is pretty good these days. All modern browsers, Safari starting with Big Sur, support it.
</p>

{% highlight "html" %}
<picture>
  <source srcset="/images/7_avif-support.avif" type="image/avif">
  <img src="/images/7_avif-support.webp" width="740" height="251" alt="caniuse.com browser support chart for the avif image format" loading="lazy">
</picture>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  <a href="https://caniuse.com/webp">
    <picture>
      <source srcset="/images/7_webp-support.avif" type="image/avif">
      <img src="/images/7_webp-support.jpg" width="740" height="291" alt="caniuse.com browser support chart for the webp image format" loading="lazy">
    </picture>
  </a>
</p>

<h2>Image size comparison</h2>

<p>I took a screenshot of the HTMHell website and compressed it with OxiPNG and converted it to <code>webp</code> and <code>avif</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/images/7_example-orig.png">png untouched: 936KB</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/images/7_example-comp.png">png compressed: 438KB</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/images/7_example.webp">webp: 132KB</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/images/7_example.avif">avif: 71KB</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Pretty amazing, if you ask me. :)<br>
  There are already several compression tools out there, but I can recommend the <a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh web app</a>, if you want to get started.
