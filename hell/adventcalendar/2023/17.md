<!-- Manuel: I really like these kinds of posts. Thanks a lot for your contribution! -->

You've probably heard statements along the lines of "HTML is already accessible by default" or "You don't need to reinvent this perfectly fine HTML control". I consider these to be more of general claims rather than universal truths. It's extremely important for web developers to recognize gaps in the platform. To that end, I've decided to collect a few instances where HTML falls short, through accessibility issues or usability issues. 

This is not a comprehensive list (it doesn't even include gaps in ARIA). I wanted to find a balance between widely known issues and more frequently encountered (but lesser known) ones, while making sure to include some things that we take for granted. In each section, I will include its severity, alternate suggestions, and links where you can find more detailed information.

## `<select multiple>`

Let's start with an easy one. The [`multiple`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#multiple) attribute on `<select>` should pretty much never be used. It's like the polar opposite of single `<select>`, where instead of universal familiarity, it has universal unfamiliarity. Perhaps its only saving grace is that I have yet to encounter this attribute in any codebase. 

<!-- Manuel: 
1. ‚Äúpretty much never" <- never or pretty much never? When _can_ I use it?
2."it has universal unfamiliarity" <- are there studies that support your claim, e.g. by NN/g? -->

**Impact**: High. There is a good chance most of your users will not know how to navigate this monstrous control.

**What to use instead**: A list of checkboxes are a totally fine alternative; or you could build a custom multi-selectable listbox.

## `<i>` (for icon)

Let's do another easy one to warm up. The `<i>` element is [semantically insignificant](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#el-i), so it's fine if used for regular text content. More frequently though, it is used for icon fonts.

<!-- Manuel: Why would you use it for regular text content, if it's "semantically insignificant"? -->

I wouldn't even normally include this in the list, since this is more of a developer error than a platform issue. However, it is 2023 and I still regularly encounter the `<i>` element being used with something like FontAwesome. It looks bad, breaks often (and in hilarious ways üê¥), and leads to other accessibility issues.

<!-- Manuel:
1. "looks bad" <- what? the icons? what does that have to do with the <i> element?
2. "breaks often" <- what does that mean? do you have an example?
3. "leads to other accessibility issues" <- what kind of issues?
4. Since you're calling out FontAwesome directly, it's worth linking to their detailed a11y page: https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/dig-deeper/accessibility -->

<!-- Saptak: I agree that the kind of issues these raises need to be mentioned a little more in detail -->

**Impact**: Low to medium. You could make it less inaccessible by excluding it from the accessibility tree (using `aria-hidden`) and providing a text alternative (using [visually hidden](https://www.tpgi.com/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/) text), but it will still remain problematic.

<!-- Saptak: How are the Impact levels for each of the issue determined? -->

**What to use instead**: SVGs! They are universally supported and outright better in every conceivable way. There are tons of different ways to use them too, so you can have your pick, whether you like inlining, using sprites, or keeping it within CSS (using [`mask`](https://codepen.io/noahblon/post/coloring-svgs-in-css-background-images)).

<!-- Manuel: 
1. "outright better in every conceivable way" <- don't I have similar a11y issues if I use a svg instead of <i>? I still might have to use aria-hidden="true" or instead I'd have to add role=img and use the <title> element, but then again for universal support, I'd have to use aria-labelledby, etc. 
You make it sound like the <svg> doesn't require extra work. -->

## `title` attribute

The `title` attribute is the one that frustrates me the most, particularly because of its long history. It is so bad that the [HTML spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-title-attribute) explicitly warns against using it. And yet I've seen this attribute used in almost every codebase I've worked with.

In addition to its many usability issues (such as its inability to be zoomed), keyboard users and touch-screen users have absolutely no way of accessing the title content!

<!-- Manuel: "its many usability issues" <- since this is the attribute that frustrates you the most, you should share your frustration and list all the usabiluty and accessilibty issues. -->

**Impact**: High. By using this attribute, you are making the intentional choice of leaving out a large percentage of your users.

**What to use instead**: In many cases, including the text as part of the element's content can suffice; this text could be visually-hidden if necessary. In other cases, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` will work better than `title`.

<!-- Manuel: I kinda agree, but not completely. Yes, don't *rely* on the title attribute because it's only accessible to a limited user group. I can sign that, but using it doesn't do any harm. I doesn't break anything. Also, it's part of the accessible name computation and I've seen the title element improve a11y. Two examples:
1. <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" title="Next Page"></i> <- kinda ironic hehe
2. https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2020/08/20/hush-sweet-iframe/ <- title attr is still the best way of naming iframes. -->

In all cases, a [custom tooltip](https://www.mayank.co/blog/tooltip-using-webcomponents), in addition to the techniques described above, is the better choice for both the developer and the user.

<!-- Manuel: I don't agree because tooltips usually fucking suck if you consider more than just keyboard a11y, but that's just my personal opinion. -->

## `<datalist>`

At first, the [`datalist` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) sounds like a promising alternative to custom comboboxes. The more you use it though, the more disappointed you'll find yourself. This element has very questionable default styling, cannot be customized, is not user-scalable, and does not work on Firefox Android at all!

<!-- Manuel: 
1. "questionable default styling" <- you and I know what that means, but the reader might not. please elaborate.
2. what about screen-reader support? Do you have any info on that? for example, https://www.webaxe.org/datalist-over-aria-combobox/ -->

<!-- Saptak: What do you mean when you say "not user-scalable"? -->

**Impact**: Medium to high. At best, this element can be useful as an optional hint for input fields that would still be perfectly usable without the added help from autocompleting options.

**What to use instead**: `<select>` or a custom combobox. ü§∑

## `<ul>`/`<li>`

<!-- Manuel: 
1. what about ol?
2. This article started with "don't use multiple, i, title, and datalist", and know we're talking about lists. My first thought was 'are they seriously going to suggest to not use lists anymore?". Of course, you're not, but can you please add a sentence that makes clear how useful lists are and that it's just the combination of lists and removing list styles that is something we need to consider?)"
-->

<!-- Saptak: Just to re-emphasize Manuel's point, I agree that some people might take it as "don't use lists", which is not what you are suggesting. So making that clear would be nice. -->

I can't make a list (heh!) of problematic HTML and not include lists in there. 

Developers have a list problem ‚Äî we want to make everything a list, often just to remove list styles anyway. Sometimes we may even slap an ARIA role on it (thus overriding the list semantics), or worse, add non-`<li>` children for styling purposes or otherwise (thus producing invalid markup). In all of these scenarios, we are losing any benefit provided by list elements, and potentially introducing new issues.

Safari has noticed this problem, dubbing it "list-itis", and started removing list semantics from styled lists. While this change was surely done with good intentions, it has the unfortunate effect of making even legitimately styled lists purely presentational.

<!-- Manuel: 
1. "Developers have a list problem" <- Do you think that's still a problem? In my experience it use to be much worse years ago. Is there any ressource you could link here? Maybe the http archive web alamanc has some data to support your claim. 
2. "Safari has noticed this problem" <- It's not clear what "problem" is referring to? overriding roles? wrong nesting? overuse of lists? or all of it?
3. "from styled lists" <- I know this refers to removing list styles in the previous chapter, but readers may think that any custom styles remove sematics. It's worth listing the "bad" properties.
4. FYI: They don't do this anymore if the list is nested in a <nav> -->

**Impact**: Low. I think it's totally fine to let Safari/VoiceOver do its thing; in fact, their users are likely used to it and may even expect an almost list-free web.

**What to use instead**: `role="list"` if you really need list semantics, or just plain `<div>`s if you're already using a different role. [`<dl>`](https://benmyers.dev/blog/on-the-dl/) is another potential alternative for key-value pairs.

<!-- Manuel: Please add a code demo to show how to use role="list" -->

## `<input placeholder>`

Placeholder text is intended to *help* the user by providing a hint when an input is empty. In practice, it often ends up doing the opposite.

Placeholder text is usually prone to color contrast issues. If you try fixing color contrast, it may end up looking indistinguishable from real input values. If you put important information in it (like password requirements, or god forbid, the label itself), the input value will hide this important information as soon as the user starts typing.

**Impact**: Medium to high. At best, it may be ignored. At worst, it may frustrate your users and impact your revenue.

**What to use instead**: Nothing? A prominently visible label may be sufficient. If you do need hint text, consider placing it outside the input, and associating it using `aria-describedby`.

<!-- Manuel: a code demo could be helpful here -->

**Further reading**: [Don't Use The Placeholder Attribute](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/) (article by Eric Bailey)

## `<input type=number>`

Let's cut to the chase: number inputs will increment/decrement when using scroll wheel or gesture, making it extremely prone to accidents. Yikes! And that's in addition to its other accessibility, consistency, and styling issues.

<!-- Manuel: "other accessibility, consistency, and styling issues" <- which ones? -->

**Impact**: High. The scrolling issue alone is enough to make this a dealbreaker, as users could [enter the wrong number without even realizing](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/you-probably-dont-need-input-typenumber/).

**What to use instead**: `<input inputmode="numeric" pattern="[0-9]*">`. The [`inputmode`](https://better-mobile-inputs.netlify.app/) attribute helps show a nicer keyboard on touchscreen devices, and the [`pattern`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/pattern) attribute helps with validation.

**Further reading**: [Why the GOV.UK Design System team changed the input type for numbers](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/)

## `<input type=date>`

Native date pickers have too many browser inconsistencies. On Chrome/Safari desktop, the date picker cannot be opened using keyboard. On Safari desktop, the date picker is minuscule and cannot be scaled up. On Chrome/Firefox Android, the date input cannot be typed into, forcing the use of the clunky calendar UI even if the date is familiar to the user. In all environments, the date format is shown as placeholder text which, as we've already established, is problematic especially when it's a weird date format üá∫üá∏.

<!-- Manuel: "On Chrome/Safari desktop, the date picker cannot be opened using keyboard." <- but you can still type the date, right? So, it's not inaccessible. Also, it's not true that it can't be opened because you can open it by pressing "space". It works fine in Chrome, but in Safari you can't access or close the calender UI. -->

**Impact**: High. These inconsistencies are not just minor differences, they introduce real barriers to access.

**What to use instead**: Honestly, use simple text inputs, or even selects in some cases. 

You can also use separate inputs for date/month/year and group them with a fieldset. This fieldset could even be styled to look like [one contiguous form field](https://russmaxdesign.github.io/date-picker-input/). If you choose to hide the input labels though, I would also suggest showing the date format outside the inputs (as part of the legend or below the inputs).

<!-- Manuel: what about custom date pickers? are the better than native ones? -->

**Further ~~reading~~ watching**: [What makes an accessible date picker? Is it even possible?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Gy2WN4Iys) (talk by Russ Weakley)

## `<menu>`

Just don't. Whatever you expect this element does‚Ä¶ it probably doesn't. The `<menu>` element was originally intended to be a "context menu" but it never got anywhere, becoming effectively deprecated instead.

<!-- Manuel: 
1. "never got anywhere" <- So it's not supported by any browser/screen reader? what happens if you use it?
2. "effectively deprecated" <- what does that mean? is it deprecated or not? Are there plans to deprecate it? -->

Side note: Probably don't use `role="menu"` either, as it again might not do what you think it does. It's intended for recreating native desktop-like menus, rather than for navigation.

<!-- Manuel: I don't like that. The message should be "dont use `role="menu"` for navigation" and not "don't use it". -->

**Impact**: Low. `<menu>` is simply remapped to `<ul>`.

<!-- Manuel: are you sure? I quickly tried it in VO on macOS and Talkback on Chrome and both treated the elements differently https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/qBgNpWr -->

**What to use instead**: Some alternatives include: `<ul>` or `role="list"` when you do have a list; `role="menu"` when you do have a desktop-like menu; `role="listbox"` when you have something resembling a custom `<select>`; `<dialog>` or `role="dialog"` when you have a generic popover (perhaps with a `role="list"` inside). Do note that some of these roles require custom JavaScript interactions to be wired up.

<!-- Manuel:
1. "or `role="list"` when you do have a list" <- you mean like <menu role="list">? Why would I use role=list instead of ul? 
2. I'm a bit confused by your suggestions because they range from list to dialog. Previously you said <menu> is for context menus, so it would make sense to only offer an alternative solutions for context menus here. -->

## `<button disabled>`

Disabled buttons are strangely overused, perhaps due to their familiarity. It seems all too convenient to slap an attribute onto a button, and lo-and-behold, it suddenly prevents clicks!

<!-- Manuel: imo too snarky. disabled is a well supported attribute and outside of the a11y and maybe ux bubble no one tells you that it's bad, so why not use it? -->

Two common scenarios for disabled buttons include:
- when temporarily unavailable, perhaps due to requiring some prerequisite action (such as selecting an item or filling a form).
- when submitting a form, to prevent duplicate submissions.

However, the `disabled` attribute does more than just prevent clicks. It also prevents hover and focus capabilities. This has many negative ramifications. Disabled buttons cannot show tooltips (which may be important for explaining why the button is disabled). Focus could get lost and create a confusing experience if a button suddenly becomes disabled. Additionally, disabled buttons are exempt from [color contrast requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html), increasing the likelihood that it will have poor contrast.

<!-- Manuel: Disabled buttons are also not available to keyboard and screen reader user navigating with the keyboard -->

**Impact**: High. Disabled buttons selectively serve a small percentage of your user-base (and not very well either).

**What to use instead**: start with `disabled` in the initial markup, then use JavaScript to change it to `aria-disabled="true"`  and manually disable clicks. If possible though, consider reworking the design to avoid needing disabled buttons altogether.

<!-- Manuel: why the extra step? progressive enhancement? to make sure it's also disabled when CSS and JS don't load? -->

**Further reading**: [Making Disabled Buttons More Inclusive](https://css-tricks.com/making-disabled-buttons-more-inclusive/) (article by Sandrina Pereira)

## `<video>`

The native video player still has many accessibility and usability issues. For keyboard users, focus is a recurring issue because the controls become hidden once the video starts playing. For screen reader users, the experience seems to be awkward or lacking, especially for more "advanced" features, like picture-in-picture mode.

<!-- Manuel:
1. afaik keyboard a11y is also a problem. not all controls are (fully) accessible
2. "seems to be awkward or lacking" <- it seems to be or is that a fact? do you have a source for that rather vague claim. -->

**Impact**: Medium to high.

**What to use instead**: Unsure. Maybe a custom video player, if it's built with accessibility in mind. I would just like the native video player to be more accessible. Regardless of what you use, please include captions and a transcript, and provide a way to download the video for offline viewing in the user's player of choice. Oh and please for the love of god do not use `autoplay`.

<!-- Saptak: Can you maybe link some source as to why one should not use `autoplay`. Not everyone might be aware. -->

**Further reading**: [How accessible is the HTML video player?](https://scottvinkle.me/blogs/work/how-accessible-is-the-html-video-player) (article by Scott Vinkle) and [Browser Video Players Review](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/09/browser-video-players-review.html) (article by Adrian Roselli)

##  Link protocols (`tel:`, `mailto:`)

Links on the web can have a [non-http protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler/Web-based_protocol_handlers) like `mailto:` or `tel:`. These protocols are commonly used as a supposed way to help the users (or spammers) send an email or dial a number. However, this makes a very bold assumption is that the user is visiting the webpage on the same device that will be used to send the email or dial a number and wants to use the default application to do so. To make it worse, the actual address/number often gets hidden underneath the link, instead displaying something useless like "Email me".

<!-- Manuel: I'm confused by the sentence starting with "To make it worse". Are you talking about to separate arguments? Because it feel like it's the same, right? Again, similar to the ul/li chapter, it sounds like tel: and mail:to are bad, but that's not what you're saying. It's about the link text, right? -->

**Impact**: Low to medium. It's confusing and annoying, but not the end of world I suppose. Users will (reluctantly) find workarounds. You can slightly ameliorate it by including the email address or phone number as part of the link text.

**What to use instead**: Just show the actual email address or phone number. It is trivial to copy or manually transfer it over to the desired device. Additionally, many devices will automatically display a prompt when selecting text that can be recognized as an email/number.

<!-- Manuel: You're saying the same thing twice in "impact" and "what to use instead" -->

## Wrapping up

In closing, I just want to reiterate that accessibility is not as simple as "just use HTML". Even with best intentions and pristine HTML source, we may end up with inaccessible UIs if we don't do our due diligence.

I'm sure this list will look different (hopefully shorter) 10 years from now. As more people start to take interest in these things, it will create more awareness. It will push standards bodies and browser vendors to improve the platform and get us closer to a more "accessible by default" web.
