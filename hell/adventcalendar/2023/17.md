You've probably heard statements along the lines "HTML is already accessible by default" or "You don't need reinvent this perfectly fine HTML control". I consider these to be more of general claims rather than universal truths. It's extremely important for web developers to recognize gaps in the platform. To that end, I've decided to collect a few instances where HTML falls short, through accessibility issues or usability issues. 

This is not a comprehensive list (it doesn't even include gaps in ARIA). I wanted to find a balance between widely known issues and more frequently encountered (but lesser known) ones, while making sure to include some things that we take for granted. In each section, I will include its severity, alternate suggestions, and links where you can find more detailed information.

## `<select multiple>`

Let's start with an easy one. The [`multiple`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#multiple) attribute on `<select>` should pretty much never be used. It's like the polar opposite of single `<select>`, where instead of universal familiarity, it has universal unfamiliarity. Perhaps its only saving grace is that I have yet to encounter this attribute in any codebase. 

**Impact**: High. There is a good chance most of your users will not know how to how to navigate this monstrous control.

**What to use instead**: A list of checkboxes are a totally fine alternative; or you could build a custom multi-selectable listbox.

## `<i>` (for icon)

Let's do another easy one to warm up. The `<i>` element is [semantically insignificant](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#el-i), so it's fine if used for regular text content. More frequently though, it is used for icon fonts.

I wouldn't even normally include this in the list, since this is more of a developer error than a platform issue. However, it is 2023 and I still regularly encounter the `<i>` element being used with something like FontAwesome. It looks bad, breaks often (and in hilarious ways üê¥), and leads to other accessibility issues.

**Impact**: Low to medium. You could make it less inaccessible by excluding it from the accessibility tree (using `aria-hidden`) and providing a text alternative (using [visually hidden](https://www.tpgi.com/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/) text), but it will still remain problematic.

**What to use instead**: SVGs! They are universally supported and outright better in every conceivable way. There are tons of different ways to use them too, so you can have your pick, whether you like inlining, using sprites, or keeping it within CSS (using [`mask`](https://codepen.io/noahblon/post/coloring-svgs-in-css-background-images)).

## `title` attribute

The `title` attribute is the one that frustrates me the most, particularly because of its long history. It is so bad that the [HTML spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-title-attribute) explicitly warns against using it. And yet I've seen this attribute used in almost every codebase I've worked with.

In addition to its many usability issues (such as its inability to be zoomed), keyboard users and touch-screen users have absolutely no way of accessing the title content!

**Impact**: High. By using this attribute, you are making the intentional choice of leaving out a large percentage of your users.

**What to use instead**: In many cases, including the text as part of the element's content can suffice; this text could be visually-hidden if necessary. In other cases, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` will work better than `title`.

In all cases, a [custom tooltip](https://www.mayank.co/blog/tooltip-using-webcomponents), in addition to the techniques described above, is the better choice for both the developer and the user.

## `<datalist>`

At first, the [`datalist` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) sounds like a promising alternative to custom comboboxes. The more you use it though, the more disappointed you'll find yourself. This element has very questionable default styling, cannot be customized, is not user-scalable, and does not work on Firefox Android at all!

**Impact**: Medium to high. At best, this element can be useful as an optional hint for input fields that would still be perfect usable without the added help from autocompleting options.

**What to use instead**: `<select>` or a custom combobox. ü§∑

## `<ul>`/`<li>`

I can't make a list (heh!) of problematic HTML and not include lists in there. 

Developers have a list problem ‚Äî we want to make everything a list, often just to remove list styles anyway. Sometimes we may even slap an ARIA role on it (thus overriding the list semantics), or worse, add non-`<li>` children for styling purposes or otherwise (thus producing invalid markup). In all of these scenarios, we are losing any benefit provided by list elements, and potentially introducing new issues.

Safari has noticed this problem, dubbing it "list-itis", and started removing list semantics from styled lists. While this change was surely done with good intentions, it has the unfortunate effect of making even legitimately styled lists purely presentational.

**Impact**: Low. I think it's totally fine to let Safari/VoiceOver do its thing; in fact, their users are likely used to it and may even expect an almost list-free web.

**What to use instead**: `role="list"` if you really need list semantics, or just plain `<div>`s if you're already using a different role. [`<dl>`](https://benmyers.dev/blog/on-the-dl/) is another potential alternative for key-value pairs.

## `<input placeholder>`

Placeholder text is intended to *help* the user by providing a hint when an input is empty. In practice, it often ends up doing the opposite.

Placeholder text is usually prone to color contrast issues. If you try fixing color contrast, it may end up looking indistinguishable from real input values. If you put important information in it (like password requirements, or god forbid, the label itself), the input value will hide this important information as soon as the user starts typing.

**Impact**: Medium to high. At best, it may be ignored. At worst, it may frustrate your users and impact your revenue.

**What to use instead**: Nothing? A prominently visible label may be sufficient. If you do need hint text, consider placing it outside the input, and associating it using `aria-describedby`.

## `<input type=number>`

Let's cut to the chase: number inputs will increment/decrement when using scroll wheel or gesture, making it extremely prone to accidents. Yikes! And that's in addition to its other accessibility, consistency, and styling issues.

**Impact**: High. The scrolling issue alone is enough to make this a dealbreaker, as users could [enter the wrong number without even realizing](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/you-probably-dont-need-input-typenumber/).

**What to use instead**: `<input inputmode="numeric" pattern="[0-9]*">`. The [`inputmode`](https://better-mobile-inputs.netlify.app/) attribute helps show a nicer keyboard on touchscreen devices, and the [`pattern`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/pattern) attribute helps with validation.

## `<input type=date>`

Native date pickers have too many browser inconsistencies. On Chrome/Safari desktop, the date picker cannot be opened using keyboard. On Safari desktop, the date picker is minuscule and cannot be scaled up. On Chrome/Firefox Android, the date input cannot be typed into, forcing the use of the clunky calendar UI even if the date is familiar to the user. In all environments, the date format is shown as placeholder text which, as we've already established, is problematic especially when it's a weird date format üá∫üá∏.

**Impact**: High. These inconsistencies are not just minor differences, they introduce real barriers to access.

**What to use instead**: Honestly, use simple text inputs, or even selects in some cases. 

You can also use separate inputs for date/month/year and group them with a fieldset. This fieldset could even be styled to look like [one contiguous form field](https://russmaxdesign.github.io/date-picker-input/). If you choose to hide the input labels though, I would also suggest showing the date format outside the inputs (as part of the legend or below the inputs).

## `<menu>`

Just don't. Whatever you expect this element does‚Ä¶ it probably doesn't. The `<menu>` element was originally intended to be a "context menu" but it never got anywhere, becoming effectively deprecated instead.

Side note: Probably don't use `role="menu"` either, as it again might not do what you think it does. It's intended for recreating native desktop-like menus, rather than for navigation.

**Impact**: Low. `<menu>` is simply remapped to `<ul>`.

**What to use instead**: Some alternatives include: `<ul>` or `role="list"` when you do have a list; `role="menu"` when you do have a desktop-like menu; `role="listbox"` when you have something resembling a custom `<select>`; `<dialog>` or `role="dialog"` when you have a generic popover (perhaps with a `role="list"` inside). Do note that some of these roles require custom JavaScript interactions to be wired up.

## `<button disabled>`

Disabled buttons are strangely overused, perhaps due to their familiarity. It seems all too convenient to slap an attribute onto a button, and lo-and-behold, it suddenly prevents clicks!

Two common scenarios for disabled buttons include:
- when temporarily unavailable, perhaps due to requiring some prerequisite action (such as selecting an item or filling a form).
- when submitting a form, to prevent duplicate submissions.

However, the `disabled` attribute does more than just prevent clicks. It also prevents hover and focus capabilities. This has many negative ramifications. Disabled buttons cannot show tooltips (which may be important for explaining why the button is disabled). Focus could get lost and create a confusing experience if a button suddenly becomes disabled. Additionally, disabled buttons are exempt from [color contrast requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html), increasing the likelihood that it will have poor contrast.

**Impact**: High. Disabled buttons selectively serve a small percentage of your user-base (and not very well either).

**What to use instead**: start with `disabled` in the initial markup, then use JavaScript to change it to `aria-disabled="true"`  and manually disable clicks. If possible though, consider reworking the design to avoid needing disabled buttons altogether.

## `<video>`

The native video player still has many accessibility and usability issues. For keyboard users, focus is a recurring issue because the controls become hidden once the video starts playing. For screen reader users, the experience seems to be awkward or lacking, especially for more "advanced" features, like picture-in-picture mode.

**Impact**: Medium to high.

**What to use instead**: Unsure. Maybe a custom video player, if it's built with accessibility in mind. Honestly, I would just like the native video player to be more accessible. Regardless of what you use, please include captions and a transcript, and provide a way to download the video for offline viewing in the user's player of choice. Oh and please for the love of god do not use `autoplay`.

##  Link protocols (`tel:`, `mailto:`)

Links on the web can have a [non-http protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler/Web-based_protocol_handlers) like `mailto:` or `tel:`. These protocols are commonly used as a supposed way to help the users (or spammers) send an email or dial a number. However, this makes a very bold assumption is that the user is visiting the webpage on the same device that will be used to send the email or dial a number and wants to use the default application to do so. To make it worse, the actual address/number often gets hidden underneath the link, instead displaying something useless like "Email me".

**Impact**: Low to medium. It's confusing and annoying, but not the end of world I suppose. Users will (reluctantly) find workarounds. You can slightly ameliorate it by including the email address or phone number as part of the link text.

**What to use instead**: Just show the actual email address or phone number. It is trivial to copy or manually transfer it over to the desired device. Additionally, many devices will automatically display a prompt when selecting text that can be recognized as an email/number.

## Wrapping up

In closing, I just want to reiterate that accessibility is not as simple as "just use HTML". Even with best intentions and pristine HTML source, we may end up with inaccessible UIs if we don't do our due diligence.

I'm sure this list will look different (hopefully shorter) 10 years from now. As more people start to take interest in these things, it will create more awareness. It will push standards bodies and browser vendors to improve the platform and get us closer to a more "accessible by default" web.
