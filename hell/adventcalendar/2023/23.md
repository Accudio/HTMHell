Semantic and accessible HTML serves as a powerful tool, enhancing not only human interaction but also the efficiency of software systems. In web development, it's not just about making things easier for people; it's equally vital for enabling seamless interactions between your website and other software components.
Let's dive into how this often-overlooked aspect can revolutionize your testing processes and save you valuable time.

## The Connection Between Semantic HTML, Accessibility, and Testing

This topic was beautifully explored by Rita Castro, in her talk [a11y and TDD: A Perfect Match](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/a11y-and-tdd-a-perfect-match). While Rita mainly focuses on unit tests, it's worth mentioning how these principles can be applied to end-to-end testing as well, and for the same reasons.

## The End-to-End Testing Dilemma

End-to-end testing, goes beyond checking individual parts of a website. It tries to act like a real user in a real web browser, testing the whole webpage as it would appear to someone using it for real.

Let's imagine we are writing a unit test for a list item component, that produces the following HTML:

```html
<li>
	A description for this item
  <button type="button">Pick this item</button>
</li>
```

And the unit test can target the button like this:

```js
screen.getByRole('button')
```

This approach is great for testing the component in isolation, which is what "unit" means. It simplifies testing by not worrying about other possible buttons on the page and by ignoring context.

However, unit tests can't fully replicate real-life scenarios. For instance, they can't ensure that clicking the button saves some data for the current user and navigates to another page.

Now, consider our list item used in a full web page, with a topbar that contains buttons and other sections beyond the list container. The page wasn't build with semantics and accessibility in mind, so it looks like this (taken from real production web application page):

```html
<body>
  <div id="root">
    <div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <!-- topbar -->
            </div>
            <div>
              <div>
                <header>
                  <div>
                    <h1>Page Title</h1>
                    <h3>Page subtitle</h3>
                  </div>
                </header>
                <div>
                  <!-- a form for filtering the list -->
                  <hr />
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      <div>
                        <div>
                          <div>
                            <p>A description for this item</p>
                          </div>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                        <button>
                          <span> Pick this item </span>
                        </button>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      <div>
                        <!-- second item -->
                      </div>
                      <!-- ... -->
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

Most end-to-end testing tools can record your actions as you interact with a webpage and then use those actions for automation. They save selectors automatically to identify the things you interact with.
We want to test the click of the button in the first element in the list. I have to confess I simplified a bit the HTML in the example, and the real selector produced by the tool looks like this:

```
//*[@id="root"]/div/div/div/div/div/div/div[3]/div/div/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/button
```

Whenever you tweak your HTML, even a little bit, your test suite can easily get messed up in this situation. End-to-end tests aren't something you update every day because they are slow and need lots of resources. So, figuring out why a test failed can be time-consuming and take away from more important tasks.

## The Power of Semantic HTML in Testing

Now, envision a different scenario where your web page is built with clean, semantic HTML. You could simply target the first item in the list like this:

```
li:first-child > button
```

Regardless of any HTML changes you make around the list, your test remains rock-solid.

## Why It Matters

So, why should you care about semantic HTML and accessibility in testing?

* **Developer and QA Bliss**: Life becomes easier for developers and QA engineers. Writing tests becomes a breeze when you can work with straightforward, semantic code.
* **Mimicking Real Users**: Your tests better mimic real user behavior. Real users aren't concerned with complex div hierarchies; they interact with headings, buttons, links, and familiar interface elements with clear labels.
* **Reliability and Time Savings**: Your tests become more reliable and won't break with every deployment for arbitrary reasons. Say goodbye to countless hours spent tweaking tests and hello to more productive work.

In conclusion, embracing semantic HTML and accessibility in your development process isn't just about adhering to best practices; it's a game-changer for testing. It streamlines your testing efforts, makes your tests more realistic, and ensures they stand the test of timeâ€”saving you precious hours and frustration. So, don't underestimate the power of clean code; it could be your testing superhero in disguise.
