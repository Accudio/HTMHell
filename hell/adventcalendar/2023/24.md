## Template for accessibility guidlines

Are you responsible for accessibility issues and want or need to set internal policies within your company? Then this template could be a good starting point.

I created it based on my previous experience with companies and clients, but also adapted it to the tech stack of the respective company. For this reason I suggest for example Figma as a tool, but you can replace it with whatever is being used where you work.

My goal was not to go into too much detail, but still address the most important topics. The reason for this is so that it remains clear and can be easily expanded. Also, I wanted to add links for reference that are not too technical and thus can be used as a reference by non-developers.

## 1. Purpose

To ensure that our products are usable and accessible, we comply with level **AA success** criteria of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/). For a better understanding of these guidelines, check out the following resources:

- [WCAG AAA in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-but-in-language-i-can-understand) by tempertemper
- [WCAG 2.1 Map](https://intopia.digital/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-WCAG2.1-Map-Intopia-plus-reading-order.pdf) by Intopia
- [Accessibility Not-Checklist](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/) by Intopia

**Accessibility is a group effort and not a one-person show.** It goes beyond leaving it to designers or developers. Being aware and curious about it will not only help you but also the people around you.

**It is not possible to create a product that is 100% accessible.** However, this is no reason to give up or to not start at all. “Progress over perfection” is our approach, because every little improvement counts and will make someone’s life easier.

## 2. Design

*In this phase there is the greatest potential to avoid adaptations regarding accessibility afterwards. You can find related links to the topics mentioned here under [Development](#3-development).*

  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of color contrast using 'not compliant', level AA and AAA on the Xiaomi website" src="/images/advent2023/color-contrast-example.png">
</a>

**Color contrast** is level AA compliant, if possible level AAA compliant. If text is in front of an image, provide a layer in between.

<a href="/images/advent2023/font-size-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of font size using 8, 14 and 16 pixels on the Jysk website" src="/images/advent2023/font-size-example.png">
</a>

**Font size** is at least 14 pixels, preferably 16 pixels.

<a href="/images/advent2023/touch-target-size-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of touch target size using 24 by 24 & 44 by 44 pixels on the Bosch website" src="/images/advent2023/touch-target-size-example.png">
</a>

**Touch target size** should be at least 44 x 44 pixels, preferably more.

<a href="/images/advent2023/convey-meaning-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing icons with and without text labels on the H&M website" src="/images/advent2023/convey-meaning-example.png">
</a>

**Convey meaning** not only through colors or icons. If possible, add a descriptive label to the element in question.

<a href="/images/advent2023/focus-state-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference between a barely and a clearly visible focus state on the Tomorrow Bank website" src="/images/advent2023/focus-state-example.png">
</a>

All interactive elements have a **clearly visible focus state**. It might be a change of background and font color, or a focus ring. If the latter, it should have a width and offset of at least 2 pixels.

**User flow** takes not only mouse, but also keyboard and screen reader users into consideration.

Provide a version of your design with **landmarks highlighted**. This will help to communicate with developers and improve accessibility across all browsers: [Using Landmarks in Figma](https://www.getstark.co/support/getting-started/using-landmarks)

A design is only ready for development, if it has been **approved by at least one developer**. The design review happens directly in Figma by adding comments. All open conversations must be resolved before moving on.

## 3. Development

*Accessibility and SEO go hand in hand. After approving a design, implement it with the correct HTML elements to create a robust and usable product.*

Use **semantic HTML** wherever possible to leverage native browser behavior. If progressive enhancement is needed, apply it with CSS and / or JavaScript. Related link: [Progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement)

Add a **skip link** so keyboard users can jump straight to the main content. This also requires a `<main>` element present in the DOM. Related links:

- [Creating "Skip Navigation" Links](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/#creating)
- [Documentation `<main>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)

**Heading levels** should be used appropriately and not be skipped. If a heading needs to look a certain way, apply a CSS class instead of using the wrong HTML element. Related link: [The HTML Section Heading elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)

For **typography**, use a relative unit like `rem` instead of `px`. This will give users the ability to adjust the font size to their needs. Also install fonts locally instead of fetching them from an external source to improve performance. Related link: [The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#accessibility-considerations-5)

Make sure you use the right element when deciding between **a button and a link** (actually called anchor). A button does something, an anchor element changes the URL in the browser. Both elements should have an accessible name for optimal screen reader support and search engine optimisation. Related links:

- [Documentation `button` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)
- [Documentation `a` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)
- [Button versus links](https://css-tricks.com/buttons-vs-links/)

Interactive elements can be **operated by mouse, keyboard and a screen reader**. If such an element must consist only of an icon or color (which it should not), provide an accessible name with `aria-label`.

Images must have **descriptive alternative text**. If they are purely decorative, use `alt=””`. Otherwise provide a sufficient description. Related link: [What’s the alternative? How to write good alt text](https://design102.blog.gov.uk/2022/01/14/whats-the-alternative-how-to-write-good-alt-text/)

## 4. Testing

*Whether you work in design, development or quality assurance: Testing is an essential part of the job and happens during the process and before you ship anything.*

To check **WCAG conformance** of color contrast anywhere, use the [Colour Contrast Analyser by TPGi](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/).
In **Figma**, there are a couple of great plugins to check for accessibility. **Stark** has a great UI and the free version offers **contrast check, adding landmarks and vision simulator**. Another noteworthy plugin is [A11y - Focus Order](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731310036968334777/A11y---Focus-Order).

**Use different browsers to test** what you are working on. Google **Chrome** (Chromium engine) and Mozilla **Firefox** (Gecko engine) can be used on any operating system. When using MacOS, use Apple **Safari** (WebKit engine) as well.

**Browser extensions** are a free and quick way to run accessibility scans. Most of them are based on the axe-core library, so a mix of the following will cover enough ground:

- [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/)
- [LERA](https://advancedbytez.com/lera/) (to generate reports)
- [Stark](https://www.getstark.co/) (to generate reports)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)

A **screen reader** will help you to understand the structure of a page or element. It will also show you a different way of user interaction. On **Windows** you can use [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) (paid) or [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) (free). [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/) is available on all *Apple* devices for free. For **Android** you can use [Talkback](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en). Related link: [Guides to browsing and navigating content with a screen reader by Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/testing-environment-setup/#guides-to-browsing-and-navigating-content-with-a-screen-reader)

Integrating accessibility checks into the **deployment pipeline** is another great way to ensure requirements are met. For example a push or merge will not be possible if there are linting errors or a failed unit test. Related links:
