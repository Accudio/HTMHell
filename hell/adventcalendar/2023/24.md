## Template for accessibility guidlines

Are you responsible for accessibility issues and want or need to set internal policies within your company? Then this template could be a good starting point.

<!-- Manuel: "Are you responsible for accessibility issues " <- as in "are you the one who caused them"? I guess not. You probably mean someone who's responsible for accessibility related questions within the company, right? That would also mean that the target audience for the template and also the blog post is anyone responsible for accessibility reated matters no matter their qualification. It could be a dev, designer, oder PO. Is that correct? Could be worth mentioning. -->

<!-- Eric: I might suggest leading with something along the lines of, "This template is a good starting point for you if‚Ä¶" Communicate what you're offering, and then why right out of the gate. -->

I created it based on my previous experience with companies and clients, but also adapted it to the tech stack of the respective company. For this reason I suggest for example Figma as a tool, but you can replace it with whatever is being used where you work.

<!-- Manuel: When I first read that I thought you're saying that you recommend Figma as tool for creating the template. Also, wouldn't it make more sense to make these guidelines more generic or at least try to avoid proprietary software? -->

<!-- Eric: What kinds of companies? What size? What domain? Clarifying this will help convince someone to continue reading, iof they see their work environment use case represented here. -->

My goal was not to go into too much detail, but still address the most important topics. The reason for this is so that it remains clear and can be easily expanded. Also, I wanted to add links for reference that are not too technical and thus can be used as a reference by non-developers.

<!-- Manuel: is the TOC where the template starts? Then please announce it with a sentence. -->

<!-- Eric: Could we qualify what you mean by "important topics" a little bit more? Are the high-impact, and how do you make that determination? -->

## 1. Purpose

To ensure that our products are usable and accessible, we comply with level **AA success** criteria of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/). For a better understanding of these guidelines, check out the following resources:

<!-- Saptak: Should the template link to WCAG 2.2 given that's the current recommendation? The issue with that might be that a lot of links referenced below are still using WCAG 2.1 standards. -->

- [WCAG AAA in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-but-in-language-i-can-understand) by tempertemper
- [WCAG 2.1 Map](https://intopia.digital/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-WCAG2.1-Map-Intopia-plus-reading-order.pdf) by Intopia
- [Accessibility Not-Checklist](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/) by Intopia

<!-- Manuel: Where's the AAA coming from? The title of the post is "WCAG, but in language I can understand" -->
<!-- Saptak: +1 to what Manuel said. It seems to cover all success criteria irrespective of the level. -->

**Accessibility is a group effort and not a one-person show.** It goes beyond leaving it to designers or developers. Being aware and curious about it will not only help you but also the people around you.

<!-- Eric: Love the framing here, and wonder if we can touch on this thought earlier in the intro as well. That way you can also communicate that the template is for more than just your own work. -->

**It is not possible to create a product that is 100% accessible.** However, this is no reason to give up or to not start at all. ‚ÄúProgress over perfection‚Äù is our approach, because every little improvement counts and will make someone‚Äôs life easier.

## 2. Design

*In this phase there is the greatest potential to avoid adaptations regarding accessibility afterwards. You can find related links to the topics mentioned here under [Development](#3-development).*

<!-- Manuel: Observation: You have an underlined sentence in all chapters but the first. -->
<!-- Manue: "greatest potential to avoid adaptations regarding accessibility afterwards" <- I'd say that the greatest potential to avoid them happens at least one step earlier. -->

<!-- Manuel: In the list below, wouldn't it make more sense to start with the text first followed by the image instead of the other way around? -->
<!-- Manuel: For each examole, please link to the criteria in WCAG it fails. -->

<a href="/images/advent2023/color-contrast-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of color contrast using 'not compliant', level AA and AAA on the Xiaomi website" src="/images/advent2023/color-contrast-example.png">
</a>

<!-- Manuel: Not the best example: generic link text and link with no underline. üò¨ -->

**Color contrast** is level AA compliant, if possible level AAA compliant. If text is in front of an image, provide a layer in between.

<!-- Manuel: rephrase "**Color contrast** must be AA compliant, if possible AAA" -->

<!-- Eric: For these rules, can we also link to the most applicable SC? That way it reinforces what you say with actual, objective content backing it up so it seems more authoritative. -->

<a href="/images/advent2023/font-size-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of font size using 8, 14 and 16 pixels on the Jysk website" src="/images/advent2023/font-size-example.png">
</a>

<!-- Manuel: In the JYSK example it says "not compliant". According to which guidelines? WCAG or this template? Afaik, there isn't a minimum font size requirement in WCAG. I could be wrong, though. -->
<!-- Saptak: I think WCAG only mentions that it should be allowed to zoom to at least 200% and there is criteria related to text spacing. I am not aware of any font size mention. -->
<!-- Eric: Yep, just dealt with this at work. No minimum font size, just zoom support. -->

**Font size** is at least 14 pixels, preferably 16 pixels.

<a href="/images/advent2023/touch-target-size-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of touch target size using 24 by 24 & 44 by 44 pixels on the Bosch website" src="/images/advent2023/touch-target-size-example.png">
</a>

**Touch target size** should be at least 44 x 44 pixels, preferably more.

<a href="/images/advent2023/convey-meaning-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing icons with and without text labels on the H&M website" src="/images/advent2023/convey-meaning-example.png">
</a>

<!-- Manuel: Same as Jysk: Not compliant according to which guidelines? -->

<!-- Eric: Spec only demands a 24px device pixels for AA-level. We could mention this, and then also say 44px is better for larger, friendlier tough targets‚Äîkind of like a "good, better, best" approach. -->

**Convey meaning** not only through colors or icons. If possible, add a descriptive label to the element in question.

<a href="/images/advent2023/focus-state-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference between a barely and a clearly visible focus state on the Tomorrow Bank website" src="/images/advent2023/focus-state-example.png">
</a>

All interactive elements have a **clearly visible focus state**. It might be a change of background and font color, or a focus ring. If the latter, it should have a width and offset of at least 2 pixels.

**User flow** takes not only mouse, but also keyboard and screen reader users into consideration.

<!-- Manuel: can you explain "User flow" or link to a ressource that explains what it is? -->

<!-- Eric: How specifically do you take a keyboard-only or screen reader users into consideration? -->

Provide a version of your design with **landmarks highlighted**. This will help to communicate with developers and improve accessibility across all browsers: [Using Landmarks in Figma](https://www.getstark.co/support/getting-started/using-landmarks)

A design is only ready for development, if it has been **approved by at least one developer**. The design review happens directly in Figma by adding comments. All open conversations must be resolved before moving on.

<!-- Manuel: Most of those things are also WCAG criteria, but you don't mention all design related recommendations in WCAG. I don't know how you picked those exactly, but I think you should mention that this list isn't extensive and that there's more you need to consider. -->

<!-- Saptak: I am not so sure about "approved by at least one developer". Maybe more like "approved by at least one accessibility expert" or something similar. I think it gives the wrong notion that only a developer knows accessibility issues and not a designer. In my experience, there are many designers with far more accessibility expertise than many developers. -->

<!-- Eric: +1 to Saptak's comment. Each organization has a different release process (or none at all), and genericize the language here might help a reader out. Instead, we might want to speak to the desired outcome and not the process: we want a developer to review it as a signifier that they understand what is to be expected of them and their team. -->

<!-- Saptak: "The design review happens directly in Figma by adding comments" I think this is a good opportunity to maybe talk about accessibility annotations? And link to something like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDCd-isluUY -->

## 3. Development
<!-- Manuel: The tips you give here are fine but they also seem super random. Why and how did you come up with those suggestions specifically? -->

*Accessibility and SEO go hand in hand. After approving a design, implement it with the correct HTML elements to create a robust and usable product.*

<!-- Eric: I might suggest not leading with SEO. Doing accessibility for accessibility's sake should be enough. Leading with something that defocuses that artificially chips away at its credibility. -->

Use **semantic HTML** wherever possible to leverage native browser behavior. If progressive enhancement is needed, apply it with CSS and / or JavaScript. Related link: [Progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement)

Add a **skip link** so keyboard users can jump straight to the main content. This also requires a `<main>` element present in the DOM. Related links:

- [Creating "Skip Navigation" Links](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/#creating)
- [Documentation `<main>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)

**Heading levels** should be used appropriately and not be skipped. If a heading needs to look a certain way, apply a CSS class instead of using the wrong HTML element. Related link: [The HTML Section Heading elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)

<!-- Manuel: I think I know what you're trying to say, but it's not clear enough that you're recommending to avoid using certain heading levels only for they sake of their visuals. -->

For **typography**, use a relative unit like `rem` instead of `px`. This will give users the ability to adjust the font size to their needs. Also install fonts locally instead of fetching them from an external source to improve performance. Related link: [The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#accessibility-considerations-5)

Make sure you use the right element when deciding between **a button and a link** (actually called anchor). A button does something, an anchor element changes the URL in the browser. Both elements should have an accessible name for optimal screen reader support and search engine optimisation. Related links:

<!-- Manuel: A link also does something, not just a button. Also, not all links change the url (email, tel) -->

- [Documentation `button` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)
- [Documentation `a` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)
- [Button versus links](https://css-tricks.com/buttons-vs-links/)

Interactive elements can be **operated by mouse, keyboard and a screen reader**. If such an element must consist only of an icon or color (which it should not), provide an accessible name with `aria-label`.

<!-- Saptak: Why only "mouse, keyboard and a screen reader"? There are many other assistive technologies as well. Maybe rephrase the sentence to say "mouse, keyboard, screen reader and other assistive technologies". -->

<!-- Eric: An icon-only interaction control with a concise, descriptive accessible name is technically compliant, if not necessarily ideal for situations like voice control or lower tech literacy. Can we clarify that part some? -->

Images must have **descriptive alternative text**. If they are purely decorative, use `alt=""`. Otherwise provide a sufficient description. Related link: [What‚Äôs the alternative? How to write good alt text](https://design102.blog.gov.uk/2022/01/14/whats-the-alternative-how-to-write-good-alt-text/)

## 4. Testing

*Whether you work in design, development or quality assurance: Testing is an essential part of the job and happens during the process and before you ship anything.*

To check **WCAG conformance** of color contrast, use the [Colour Contrast Analyser by TPGi](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/).
In **Figma**, there are a couple of great plugins to check for accessibility. **Stark** has a great UI and the free version offers **contrast check, adding landmarks and vision simulator**. Another noteworthy plugin is [A11y - Focus Order](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731310036968334777/A11y---Focus-Order).

**Use different browsers to test** what you are working on. Google **Chrome** (Chromium engine) and Mozilla **Firefox** (Gecko engine) can be used on any operating system. When using MacOS, use Apple **Safari** (WebKit engine) as well.

<!-- Manuel: blink engine? -->
<!-- Manuel: "can be used on any operating system" <- not on iOS -->

**Browser extensions** are a free and quick way to run accessibility scans. Most of them are based on the axe-core library, so a mix of the following will cover enough ground:

- [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/)
- [LERA](https://advancedbytez.com/lera/) (to generate reports)
- [Stark](https://www.getstark.co/) (to generate reports)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)

A **screen reader** will help you to understand the structure of a page or element. It will also show you a different way of user interaction. On **Windows** you can use [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) (paid) or [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) (free). [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/) is available on all *Apple* devices for free. For **Android** you can use [Talkback](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en). Related link: [Guides to browsing and navigating content with a screen reader by Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/testing-environment-setup/#guides-to-browsing-and-navigating-content-with-a-screen-reader)

Integrating accessibility checks into the **deployment pipeline** is another great way to ensure requirements are met. For example a push or merge will not be possible if there are linting errors or a failed unit test. Related links:

<!-- Manuel: The end is very abrupt. Please add closing words -->

<!-- Eric: +1 to Manuel's comment. If you're struggling with this part (I often do), a good piece of advice that someone taught me was to quickly try and explain what your post was about to a less-technical friend over the phone, and then use that for the conclusion. -->
