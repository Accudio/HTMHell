Want to [trigger an action](https://ashleemboyer.com/blog/should-i-use-a-button-or-a-link)? Use [a button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button). They’re great.

Want to also prevent form submission when someone clicks that button? Put down the JavaScript, friend. I have a better suggestion:

```html
<button type="button">
	Button action goes here
</button>
```

And that’s it! No  `preventDefault()` or no overwrought dependencies that will stop working without notice. Just good ol’ reliable HTML and [a humble attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attr-type).

Okay, cool, thanks!
