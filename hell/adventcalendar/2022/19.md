Do you know of `color-scheme` yet? If not, I bet you still think you do. It will certainly look familiar, as `prefers-color-scheme` has been around for longer and is clearly related.

You're in good company if it's new to you - the [State of CSS 2022](https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/features/accessibility/#color_scheme) results just came in, and 73% of respondents had never heard of it.

You probably use `prefers-color-scheme` a lot within your CSS media queries, to make a dark or light theme for your sites and apps based on user preference. Maybe you also add a toggle so people can choose their color scheme, irrespective of their OS settings. Beautiful. But now there's more to play with!

### What is it, then?

It's a property all of its own, and can save you a bunch of styling work for dark mode.

If you're like me, and tend to create little simpler sites - or if you make bigger ones with minimal styling, and you want to provide dark mode with as little extra faff as possible, you will want to explore using `color-scheme` in your HTML.

Yep, in your HTML. Before you even touch your CSS.

```html
<head>
  <meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
</head>
```

Stick the above inside your `<head></head>` and voila, your website, without any other styling, will now respond to the user's preference as set in their OS. There are default colors set in the browser for bare HTML not only in light mode, but also in dark mode. Cool, right?

<!-- MM: Which user preference? -->

<figure style="margin-bottom: 2.4rem">
<img src="/images/advent2022/19/bare-html.png" alt="Screenshot of two bare-HTML mini-sites, one light, one dark" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Comparison ofâ€¦</figcaption>
</figure>
<!-- MM: Please add a caption -->

The order of modes `light dark` or `dark light` can also make a difference - a user with no preference set will see the first mode. However, given that already most current OS (mobile and computer) versions ask you if you want light or dark mode, or even a mode that changes from one to the other automatically over the day, this may soon become less effective.

### Why do I want to use it?

Many websites leave a bunch of defaults as they are - usually light mode defaults. If they just want a white background then why declare that again? You can now do the same for dark mode.

[Some will suggest](https://dev.to/bcalou/why-you-should-always-set-a-background-color-2gb1) that these colors _should_ always be declared - but it really depends how minimal you want to be! Leave both the text and background as default, and they will both be controlled by the users themselves, via `color-scheme`.

You can see when other non-dark-mode sites have stuck with browser default colors, by opening up dev tools on them, and pasting that meta tag with just `dark` into their HTML. The bits that flip in color from light to dark (and where text goes from dark to light) were using the defaults.

Here's an example of this happening on the BBC News website, after I added a meta tag to make the `color-scheme` dark:

<img src="/images/advent2022/19/bbc-news.png" alt="BBC News Website with color-scheme: dark injected as a meta tag" loading="lazy">


Here you see they kept the main background default, but must have declared the text color - as the background darkens and renders the text almost invisible. In the "Most watched" and "Most read" sections, they've left both background and text default, and so they both flip.

### How else can I use it?

Of course you can use JavaScript to manipulate the content of the meta tag. Or, you can choose to declare color-scheme in inline styles, or just within a `*.css` file as usual. The world's your oyster.

<!-- MM: Okay, I didn't know about the CSS property either. An additional sentence that introduces the property quickly could be useful. Something like â€œAn alternative to using the meta tag isâ€¦ "-->

```js
function lightMode() {
  document
    .querySelector('meta[name="color-scheme"]')
    .setAttribute("content", "light");
}

function darkMode() {
  document
    .querySelector('meta[name="color-scheme"]')
    .setAttribute("content", "dark");
}
```

```html
<head>
  <meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
</head>

<!-- or... -->

<html lang="en" style="color-scheme: light dark">
  ...stuff goes here. Website stuff. ðŸ˜†
</html>
```
<!-- MM: Why would I use inline styles for that? If there's no particular reason, please consider removing that. -->

<!-- MM: What happens if I do both, meta and css? which one wins, CSS or HTML? -->

```css
html {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}

/* or targeting elements elsewhere, e.g. */

#light {
  color-scheme: light;
}
#dark {
  color-scheme: dark;
}
```

It's really worth experimenting. You can add the CSS to `<html>`, `<body>`, or indeed any other element, as maybe you only want parts of your site to do the flip (you might keep the header and footer the same, as an example).

### I've already styled everything for both modes.

Really, everything?

Know what else is great? It takes the default UI elements with it. The scroll bar, the select dropdowns, radio buttons and checkboxes - they all flip with color-scheme too, saving you all those little niggly UI styling jobs. Maybe you have already done this for your current project, but what about your next one?

### Any other benefits?

If you're happy to forgo a mode toggle, and also want to also save some CSS loading time? Put your dark mode and light mode styles into separate `*.css` files, and then use the prefers-color-scheme media queries in the `<link>` tags in your head to only load the relevant styles. (Once you start allowing scheme toggling outside of the user OS-set preference, trying to do this does of course get more complicated - I would only urge you to experiment!)

<!-- MM: Code sample please. -->

Have fun with it! You can thank me later ;)
