<h1>HTMHell Newsletter</h1>

<div class="preview">
  <p>
    HTMHell isnâ€™t just about bad practices, we also have good practices to share with you. We publish an HTML tip or trick every two weeks on this page, via RSS or directly delivered to your inbox via our newsletter.

  <h2>Newsletter Sign-up</h2>

  <p>
    Youâ€™ll receive an e-mail every two weeks containing quick advice for writing semantic HTML. Occasionally we might also inform you about new features on the website, but that shouldnâ€™t happen too often, because Iâ€™m really lazy.
